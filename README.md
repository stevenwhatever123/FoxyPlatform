 It is a platform game with infinite levels and random platform generations.  
 There is a 10 seconds time limit at the beginning of the game.  
 In order to gain score and extra time, the player has to keep moving and step on every platform ahead.
   
   
 I don't have an android phone, so I don't know how the game performs.  
 But from what I tested inside the engine, it works fine.
